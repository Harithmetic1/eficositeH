                    I believe strongly that a person could work for passion, money or both, whatever the case and I would delve further into what this implies.
                    Passion is self-driven, when someone says; "I have passion for this" there seems to be little or no stress with their involvement, a simple case scenario is music. Passion is mostly linked to talents, so it's possible for an individual to to decide to work without pay because of the love they have for what they do. For the money, these cases come along when these individuals are fully aware of the hard work and dedication taken by them to attain the level or standard which they already have. Most of the cases with money involved are for individuals who have acquired training in hard skills, thereby equipping themselves and are willing to offer their services.
                    Furthermore, we can also be looking at two major key points which include:
            - Time
            - Job description
                
                TIME: The time allocated for work and services by the employee to her employee goes a long way to determine whether the job could attract pay or not. A job that can possibly weigh down an average human cannot run without funds for her employees.
                JOB DESCRIPTION: Job description also plays an important role in determining whether an employee would work for the sole purpose of passion or the money. A job with little requirements can work with no pay. How a person responds is solely based on the description.
                Different people have different approaches to this issue that's arising here and there, but what matters most is that the employee in question has what it takes, be it for the passion or for the money, equipping oneself is vital.
