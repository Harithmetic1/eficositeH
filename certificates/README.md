## Efico Resources Automated Certificate Generator

To run this file locally run `pip install requirements.txt && python app.py`

To generate your certificate go to /certificate/email e.g /certificate/bayo123, if the email is authorized it displays the certificate otherwise it returns an error message in json format. Note that I ommited the domain of the email. If your email is bayo123@gmail.com the dynamic part of the url is bayo123
